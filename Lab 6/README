1.For Bubble sort for insertion, bubble, and selection sort is 0(n^2). Which means that
the worst case is that n the amount will have to do n squared amount of swaps. Its best
case is that the list is already in order and has to do no swaps at all.Except Insertion sort which has a best case of 0(n)
which makes it somewhat faster during partial sorted arrays.

2.The timing scale is increased when adding more elements to the array.The timing is also
effected exponentially by the size of the elements due to a larger amount of them.

3. Unfinished

4.Unfinished.
